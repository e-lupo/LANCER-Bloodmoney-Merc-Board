## How to Run Locally
0. **You will need Node Package Manager (NPM) and therefore Node.js to use this.** 

   For Windows at least, you'll want to install Node.js through the installer on their website here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shteb/LANCER-RPG-Job-Board.git
   cd LANCER-RPG-Job-Board
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Login** with one of the following access codes:
   - **CLIENT Mode**: Enter `IMHOTEP` (view-only access)
   - **ADMIN Mode**: Enter `TARASQUE` (full management access)

### Features

- **Terminal-Styled Interface**: Client view features a retro terminal aesthetic with green-on-black color scheme, scanline effects, and glowing text
- **Dual Access Modes**:
  - **CLIENT Mode** (Password: `IMHOTEP`): View-only grid of job cards
  - **ADMIN Mode** (Password: `TARASQUE`): Full CRUD operations for managing job postings
- **Persistent Storage**: Job data is stored in a JSON file for persistence across restarts
- **Global Settings**: Customizable settings displayed in the client view:
  - **User Group**: Displayed below the portal header (e.g., "FREELANCE_OPERATORS")
  - **UNT Date**: Universal time/date in DD/MM/YYYY format
  - **Galactic Position**: Current location in the galaxy
  - **Color Scheme**: Terminal color theme (grey, orange, green, or blue)
- **Comprehensive Job Information**: Each job card includes:
  - Job name
  - Job rank (1-3 stars)
  - Client name
  - Job description
  - Client brief
  - Currency payment (e.g., "100m")
  - Additional payment information

### Access Codes

- **CLIENT Mode**: Enter `IMHOTEP` at the landing page
- **ADMIN Mode**: Enter `TARASQUE` at the landing page

### Client View

The client view displays all job postings in a terminal-styled grid layout. Each card shows:
- Job name with rank indicator (★ stars)
- Client information
- Job description and brief
- Payment details

### Admin View

The admin panel provides a clean, functional interface for managing job postings and global settings:
- **Global Settings**: Configure system-wide settings
  - **Color Scheme**: Choose terminal color theme for client and landing views
  - **UNT**: Set the universal time/date (DD/MM/YYYY format)
  - **Current Galactic Position**: Set the current location
  - **User Group**: Set the user group name displayed in client view
- **Add New Jobs**: Fill out the form to create new job postings
- **Edit Jobs**: Click the "Edit" button to modify existing jobs
- **Delete Jobs**: Click the "Delete" button to remove jobs

## Data Persistence

Job data is stored in `data/jobs.json` and global settings are stored in `data/settings.json`. These files are automatically created on first run with default data. The files persist across restarts, ensuring your job postings and settings are saved.

**Note**: The `data/jobs.json` and `data/settings.json` files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of user data.
