## How to Run Locally
### __The Normal Way__
1. Go to releases on the right and download the latest `Lancer_Bloodmoney_Companion_X.X.X.zip`.

2. Unzip into an empty folder.

3. Run the executable for your OS (probably windows, which would be the `.exe`)

### By Cloning the repository (technical-ish)
0. **You will need Node Package Manager (NPM) and therefore Node.js to use this.** 

   For Windows at least, you'll want to install Node.js through the installer on their website here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

   You will also need Git installed, which can be done from their website here: https://git-scm.com/install/

    0.5 Open a Terminal or CMD and `cd` to a folder of your preference where this will be stored.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shteb/LANCER-Bloodmoney-Merc-Board.git
   cd LANCER-Bloodmoney-Merc-Board
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Login** with one of the following access codes:
   - **CLIENT Mode**: Enter `IMHOTEP` (view-only access)
   - **ADMIN Mode**: Enter `TARASQUE` (full management access)

## Updating
At the same folder level you ran `npm install`, now run `git pull`.
